It should provide the gallons per minute based on these assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average incoming water temperature? Searching around, I got something around 50F.  It’s August on a warm day, the lowest I measured was about 60F.. Let’s estimate the coldest will be 40F in the dead of winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target temperature is 120F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low, average, high is 40F, 50F, 60F, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature rise needed to hit the target is: 80F, 70F, 60F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the chart on the spec sheet, http://support.noritz.com/download.php?file=Literature%20Page/Spec%20Sheet/NRCP982%20SPEC.pdf&amp;amp;field=SpecSheet
the gallons per minute will vary between 3.8gpm to 5.8gpm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given at a modern shower head flows a maximum of 2.0gpm, this will work fine even when it’s winter.  It will probably handle two showers at once too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural Gas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PGE in their gas rules promises around 7 inches of water column and that’s right in line with what the heater wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas pipe size chart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     8'5&quot;(B)                         21'7&quot;(A) 80k ---------------|----------------------------------------
               |
               |
               |  17'3&quot;(C)
               |
               |
               200k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max length rounds up to 40’
“A” sees 280k and needs to be 1 inch pipe.
“B” sees 80K and needs to be 1/2
“C” sees 200K and needs 1 inch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(FOR GAS PRESSURES OF 0.5 PSI OR LESS AND A PRESSURE DROP OF 0.5-INCH WATER COLUMN)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to double check because each fitting is supposed to add ‘length’ to the total length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a water hardness meter, we get 300+ ppm.  It seems smart to consider some kind of water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noritz has a Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC) based-system but it gets poor reviews. TAC retains the calcium in the water but converts it so it doesn’t stick to pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From some searching, my favorite water treatment site (PureWater Products) had a system and as usual a nice write up.&lt;/p&gt;

It uses a lot
of water too. I wanted to replace it with something that looks good in an 
old bathroom, uses water efficiently, just works and qualifies for a rebate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terrylove.com/crtoilet.htm&quot;&gt;Terry Love’s consumer toilet reports&lt;/a&gt;
where I noted a two things. One is that TOTO toilets dominate their list of 
recommended toilets. Good since I eventually want to get a TOTO Washlet which
fits TOTO toilet bowls. Second, anything with a gram rating of 500 or more as 
tested by MaP is good. More about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From other toilet review sources, most TOTO toilets were highly rated too. So 
I felt comfortable restricted the search to only TOTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to MaP. So who knew there is a toilet rating company called MaP (Maximum Performance) and they
maintain an independent database of over 3,000 toilets? To make things simplier,
they created a category called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.map-testing.com/content/info/menu/map-premium.html&quot;&gt;MaP
Premium&lt;/a&gt; that requires the use of 1 gallon (4
liters) or less of water and a gram rating of over 600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOTO had just 2 models that fit but the Drake II 1G (C454CUFG bowl, ST453U tank)
is the only one that fit the decor. It uses only 1 gallon of water and has a 
gram rating north of 800.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bowl and tank are made in the USA and the seat was made in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our water company gives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valleywater.org/Programs/residentialHETprogram.aspx&quot;&gt;rebates&lt;/a&gt;
for high efficiency toilets (HETs) but only if its in the MaP Premium list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Our toilet was made in 1971 and it’s super hard to keep clean. It uses a lot

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
