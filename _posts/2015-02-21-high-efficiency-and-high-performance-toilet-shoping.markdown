Our toilet was made in 1971 and it's super hard to keep clean. It uses a lot
of water too. I wanted to replace it with something that looks good in an 
old bathroom, uses water efficiently, just works and qualifies for a rebate.

My first stop was [Terry Love's consumer toilet reports](http://www.terrylove.com/crtoilet.htm)
where I noted a two things. One is that TOTO toilets dominate their list of 
recommended toilets. Good since I eventually want to get a TOTO Washlet which
fits TOTO toilet bowls. Second, anything with a gram rating of 500 or more as 
tested by MaP is good. More about this later.

From other toilet review sources, most TOTO toilets were highly rated too. So 
I felt comfortable restricted the search to only TOTO.  

Back to MaP. So who knew there is a toilet rating company called MaP (Maximum Performance) and they
maintain an independent database of over 3,000 toilets? To make things simplier,
they created a category called [MaP
Premium](http://www.map-testing.com/content/info/menu/map-premium.html) that requires the use of 1 gallon (4
liters) or less of water and a gram rating of over 600.

TOTO had just 2 models that fit but the Drake II 1G (C454CUFG bowl, ST453U tank)
is the only one that fit the decor. It uses only 1 gallon of water and has a 
gram rating north of 800.

The bowl and tank are made in the USA and the seat was made in Canada.

Our water company gives [rebates](http://www.valleywater.org/Programs/residentialHETprogram.aspx) to MaP Premium
for high efficiency toilets (HETs) but only if its in the MaP Premium list.
